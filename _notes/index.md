# Basics of Creature and Character building

This is an opinionated guide on how to build better creatures and characters from lego. These are the things that I think about when building.

## Building

A good moc is one that’s easy to parse. When building, consider how the viewer sees your moc. Is it immediately obvious what all of the parts of the build are?

### Colour Blocking

- Colour blocking means having larger sections built in one colour rather than lots of small sections made of many different colours.
- Colour blocking helps us quickly and easily assign each colour to a different component of the build.

### Colour Layering

- Colour layering builds on the idea of colour blocking.
- Colours should appear layered one on top of another in a consistent order.
- It is common to use a neutral base colour, such as black or grey, as the “bottom” layer. Then, each additional “layer” of colour occurs in a particular order from inside out.

### Texture-Colour-Material Consistency

- Textural consistency means that you consistently use one combination of colour and texture to represent one "material".
- Each time we see one colour in a build, it should have the same texture and correspond to the same material.
- If we combine this with colour blocking and layering, it becomes very easy to figure out what parts of a build correspond to what.
- For example, you might have use smooth black pieces as the base layer to represent the "body" of the moc. Then, you could use larger silver pieces as a kind of armor plating. Finally, you could use red cloth elements for a cape.

### Shaping

- When building things out of lego, we often need to build up larger shapes out of smaller shapes.
- In order to create the illusion of one large shape, we want to minimize gaps between pieces and pick pieces that line up together nicely.
- We also want to connect things so that they flow naturally from one into another. If the transition between two pieces is jarring then we are less likely to see those two pieces are part of a singular greater whole.

### Connection Hiding

- We can build or pose the moc in a certain way to hide the connection points between different components.
- When the connection points are obvious, the build can feel more “like lego”, since you can see how it’s attached,
- On the other hand, if you hide connection points, then there is the illusion of continuity between the connected components.

### Familiarity

- We can take inspiration from the world around us to add familiarity to our builds.
- This could be anything:
  - Organic (e.g. antlers, fins, crab claws)
  - Man-made (e.g. guitar, jacket, headphones)
  - Natural (e.g. fire, plant, crystal)
- You can still make something brand new while referencing things we are already familiar with.

### Colour Theory

- Lego has released parts in many many colours, and continues to release more.
- This opens up lots of opportunities to play with different colour palettes.
- Colour theory can be used to create good looking colour palettes for your mocs.
- Three colours is a good minimum for a build. More colours can be added, but too many colours can lead to a moc looking cluttered.
- Complementary colours can help us understand which pairs of colours work well together. Complementary colours come from opposite ends of the colour wheel.
- In addition to colour, we also need to consider the saturation and lightness of colours. When two colours have different hues but similar saturation and brightness, it’s hard for one colour to “win” over the other, and makes it hard to differentiate them.
- We can use variations on a colour to add depth (e.g. dark brown, nougat, light nougat or green, lime green, spring green)
- The background colour you choose for your photo will also impact the relative importance of colours: light colours pop more on dark backgrounds and less on light backgrounds.
- We can pair solid colours with trans colours.Trans colours distribute light differently and can take on a glowing appearance. More than one trans colour can be distracting.
- It is common to have one or two neutral colours such as black or grey. More than two neutral colours can get messy (if they’re different, like black, dark blueish gray and light blueish gray) or can get confusing (if they’re similar, light light grey and pearl grey).

### Colour Placement

- Where we choose to place colours in our build has a lot of impact on how the viewer sees it. This is part of why colour blocking is so important.
- Our eyes are drawn to bright, vibrant colours. For example, in a build consisting of mostly darker neutral colours, a pop of yellow or red will really draw the eye.
- We can take advantage of this by putting contrasting colours in places where we want people to look. Conversely, in areas we don't want people to look (less polished, etc) we can use darker more neutral colours so that our eyes mostly ignore it.
- A good example of this is to use a bright, contrasting colour for the eyes of our moc. Humans naturally look to identify the eyes of something, so this is a good place to think carefully about colour placement.

## Presentation

For me, there are two components to moccing: building and presentation. When you’re finished your build, you want to share it with people. This usually means taking one or more photos and sharing them online.

### Background Setup

- Moc photography is similar to product photography.
- Generally speaking, we want a plain and simple background so that the focus is entirely on our moc.
- Many builders prefer to to have a single-coloured background.
- You can use a single large piece of posterboard (thick paper) to construct a seamless background. Simply tape the bottom of the posterboard to a sturdy flat surface, and tape the top to a wall. This will make a gradual curve for your background.
- The more gradual the curve, the smoother the background. However, keep in mind that you still want enough posterboard to be flat for your moc to stand on.
- If you plan on doing more extensive editing (such as replacing or recolouring the background), it can be helpful to use a background colour that does not appear anywhere in your moc for easy colour-based selection.
- I personally prefer natural light (from the sun) over artificial light (lamps, flash) for moc photography. You will want to set this up in an area with lots of natural light, but not in direct light. Most of the light should be bouncing off the walls and ceiling, rather than coming (for example) straight through a window.

### Camera Setup

- Most good-quality moc photos are taken with a dedicated camera such as a DSLR or mirrorless camera. These cameras feature better sensor resolution, low-light performance, higher dynamic range, and have more options available for lenses.
- A modern phone camera (most phone cameras released after 2020) can have comparable performance at wider focal lengths. Some builders (like me) prefer a longer focal length closer to portrait lenses, in the 50-150mm range.
- Dedicated cameras also tend to have better manual control options. Phone cameras also have manual options or apps can be purchased to expose them.
- There are three different things you can control when dialling in the exposure:
  - Aperture: This one determines how much light comes into the camera and also how much of the build is in focus. A wider aperture lets more light in and results a shallower depth-of-field (less in focus). Wider apertures have smaller f-stops (f/1.8, f/2.4, etc). A narrower aperture lets in less light and results in a wider depth-of-field (more in focus). Narrower apertures have larger f-stop (f/8, f/9, f/11, etc).
  - Because we are taking photos of our builds, we usually want all of it to be in focus. For this reason, I recommend using an aperture between f8 and f11. Narrower apertures are often possible (up to around f/22), but this results in diffraction and lower exposure and does not usually give a clearer image.
  - ISO: This one determines how sensitive your camera’s sensor is to light. If you decrease the ISO, the sensor becomes less sensitive and it takes more light to produce an equivalent exposure. If you increase the ISO, the sensor becomes less sensitive and it takes less light to produce an equivalent exposure. The higher you set the ISO, the “grainier” your images become. For a clean photo, set your ISO as low as possible. In a well-lit environment you may be able to push the ISO down to 100-200 which will result in a very clear photo. An ISO above 1000 can result in a grainy image.
  - Shutter speed: This one determines how long the camera’s shutter is open. While it’s open, the sensor will collect light. Because we are taking photos of still subjects, we have the most freedom with shutter speed. By taking photos with a self-timer and a tripod, we can get very clear images even when the shutter is open for 2-3 seconds. If you are taking photos in a room with not a lot of light, you may need to increase the shutter speed. You should never need a shutter speed faster than something like 1/32 of a second - if you are able to get a good exposure with that shutter speed then your ISO is probably too high
- Try to adjust your camera’s settings in the order of aperture -> ISO -> shutter speed.
- A tripod is a great idea when taking photos. It allows you to take clear photos with longer exposures. It also makes it easy to adjust the height of the camera relative to the build.
- When taking photos, imagine that your moc exists in the real world. Imagine that the camera is your eyes and is positioned at what would be your head height. If you imagine your moc to be taller than you, then you should position the camera below the moc’s head and angle it upwards (shooting from a “lower angle”). Shooting from a lower angle can give a build more presence and makes it feel more imposing. In contrast, if you want your build to appear smaller, you can position the camera above the moc’s head and angle it downwards (shooting from a “higher angle”). This can make a build feel smaller or more like a toy.
- One of the easiest ways to improve your presentation is to take photos from a lower angle.

### Posing

- Posing straddles the line between building and presentation. You need to build your moc so that it can be posed well.
- You want to pose your moc in a way that makes it easy to parse for the viewer. A common problem with posing is when lots of parts of the build overlap one another.

#### Silhouettes

- One thing to consider when posing your moc is its _silhouette_. The silhouette is just the shape of the outline of your moc. Different angles and poses have different silhouettes.
- A clear and strong silhouette makes a moc easy to parse and can make a moc more memorable. A muddy silhouette that just looks like a blob can make your moc harder to parse.
- One way to improve your silhouette is to ensure each part of your build gets adequate negative space around it. For example, instead of having your moc's limbs overlapping, have them splayed out more.

#### Physics

- In order to make our mocs seem more realistic and convincing, we want to think about how physics would affect our moc if it was real.
- For example, if your moc is holding a large weapon, we would expect that to be heavy. If it's just holding such a weapon straight out, that would be physically unrealistic. Instead, we should see the shoulder drop on the arm holding the weapon, and the arm should be pulled down by the weight.
- Similarly for the feet and legs, consider where the moc is placing its weight. Usually weight is not distributed perfectly evenly between feet. If the moc is leaning back, the weight might be on the back foot. If it's leaning forward, it might be on the front foot.
- You can use this to make more interesting poses where a moc is leaning in one direction or another, putting more weight on one foot.

#### Dynamics

- It's one thing to build a moc that is just "standing there". It's another thing entirely to build a moc that looks like it's actually doing something. This is even more pertinent for creature and character builders.
- We can make a moc look more alive by imparting a sense of movement to the pose. This can be difficult due to physics, so some more dynamic poses may require you to build a stand for your moc.
- By adding dynamics to our pose, we can give the impression that the photo of the moc is just a snapshot in time, and that the moc has a bit of a life of it's own outside of the photo we took.
- A basic bit of dynamics you can add to a moc is to make it look like it's stepping or walking. It is a good idea to look at reference photos for this to make sure the limbs are bent in the right way.
- A basic approach to adding dynamics is to think about the way that your moc might move. Then, pose it as if it's halfway through moving.
- Of course, it doesn't just have to be the moc that's moving. You can add dynamics to things like energy effects or the environment.

## Other

### Inspiration

- When looking at a moc, people often wonder: "What is it?"
- Sometimes you just want to make a cool dude or robot, and that's fine. But having a bit of an idea on the story or purpose behind your character help you make more sensible and cohesive design choices. A moc with a clear purpose or story is also more memorable.
- There are loads of places to look for inspiration when it comes to creature and character design. You can browse art sites like ArtStation or use an aggregation app like Pinterest. Pinterest in particular has good semantic image search, which is helpful when trying to find lots of similar images for inspiration.
- If you're someone who likes knowing what they're building before they begin (like me), it can be helpful to start by collecting inspiration.

### Stiffness

- Stiffness is something that gets talked about a lot but is hard to define.
- To me, a "stiff" moc is one that looks like it would move around like a stick figure.
- A lot of the time, this boils down to a torso that is built completely rigid, with the hips, abdomen, and shoulders consisting of one block. In real life, most things have a lot of movement in the torso.
- Adding additional flexibility in the torso can help reduce stiffness. Even a simple balljoint in the abdominal area can be enough to fix stiffness.

### Joints and Degrees of Freedom

- Mocs can look stiff when the joints have too few degrees of freedom.
- Each direction that a joint can rotate is called a "degree of freedom" (DOF).
- Generally speaking, only the knees and elbows have a single degree of freedom.
- The neck, shoulders, and hips have three degrees of freedom. The easiest way to get a full three degrees of freedom is to use ball joints (or equivalently mixel joints). You can also get three degrees of freedom using more complicated sub-assemblies built from bar and clip type pieces.
- The wrists and ankles are not full ball joints, but still have a decent amount of freedom to move. While you may be able to get away with building something that only has two degrees of freedom, you can get more natural poses by also giving these joints three degrees of freedom.

### Parts Knowledge

- Knowledge is power. France is bacon.
- Building a moc can be like solving a puzzle. “I want to connect these two pieces like this, but how?”
- With practice, you will be able to “solve” the connection in your head before reaching for pieces (or at least have an idea on how it could be done, with which parts).
- Knowing which parts exist and are available will help you find more and better solutions when building.
- bricklink.com’s catalogue contains an extensive list of all of the available lego pieces and is divided into categories.
