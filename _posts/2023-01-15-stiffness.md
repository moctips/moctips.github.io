Stiffness is something that gets talked about a lot but is hard to define.

To me, a "stiff" moc is one that looks like it would move around like a stick figure.

A lot of the time, this boils down to a torso that is built completely rigid, with the hips, abdomen, and shoulders consisting of one block. In real life, most things have a lot of movement in the torso.

Adding additional flexibility in the torso can help reduce stiffness. Even a simple balljoint in the abdominal area can be enough to fix stiffness.
