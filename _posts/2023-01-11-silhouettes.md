One thing to consider when posing your moc is its _silhouette_. The silhouette is just the shape of the outline of your moc. Different angles and poses have different silhouettes.

A clear and strong silhouette makes a moc easy to parse and can make a moc more memorable. A muddy silhouette that just looks like a blob can make your moc harder to parse.

One way to improve your silhouette is to ensure each part of your build gets adequate negative space around it. For example, instead of having your moc's limbs overlapping, have them splayed out more.
