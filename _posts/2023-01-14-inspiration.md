When looking at a moc, people often wonder: "What is it?"

Sometimes you just want to make a cool dude or robot, and that's fine. But having a bit of an idea on the story or purpose behind your character help you make more sensible and cohesive design choices. A moc with a clear purpose or story is also more memorable.

There are loads of places to look for inspiration when it comes to creature and character design. You can browse art sites like ArtStation or use an aggregation app like Pinterest. Pinterest in particular has good semantic image search, which is helpful when trying to find lots of similar images for inspiration.

If you're someone who likes knowing what they're building before they begin (like me), it can be helpful to start by collecting inspiration.
