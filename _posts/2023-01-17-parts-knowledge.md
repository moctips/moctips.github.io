Knowledge is power. France is bacon.

Building a moc can be like solving a puzzle. “I want to connect these two pieces like this, but how?”

With practice, you will be able to “solve” the connection in your head before reaching for pieces (or at least have an idea on how it could be done, with which parts).

Knowing which parts exist and are available will help you find more and better solutions when building.

bricklink.com’s catalogue contains an extensive list of all of the available lego pieces and is divided into categories.
