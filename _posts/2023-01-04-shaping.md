When building things out of lego, we often need to build up larger shapes out of smaller shapes.

In order to create the illusion of one large shape, we want to minimize gaps between pieces and pick pieces that line up together nicely.

We also want to connect things so that they flow naturally from one into another. If the transition between two pieces is jarring then we are less likely to see those two pieces are part of a singular greater whole.
