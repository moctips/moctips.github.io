In order to make our mocs seem more realistic and convincing, we want to think about how physics would affect our moc if it was real.

For example, if your moc is holding a large weapon, we would expect that to be heavy. If it's just holding such a weapon straight out, that would be physically unrealistic. Instead, we should see the shoulder drop on the arm holding the weapon, and the arm should be pulled down by the weight.

Similarly for the feet and legs, consider where the moc is placing its weight. Usually weight is not distributed perfectly evenly between feet. If the moc is leaning back, the weight might be on the back foot. If it's leaning forward, it might be on the front foot.

You can use this to make more interesting poses where a moc is leaning in one direction or another, putting more weight on one foot.
