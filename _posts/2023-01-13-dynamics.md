It's one thing to build a moc that is just "standing there". It's another thing entirely to build a moc that looks like it's actually doing something. This is even more pertinent for creature and character builders.

We can make a moc look more alive by imparting a sense of movement to the pose. This can be difficult due to physics, so some more dynamic poses may require you to build a stand for your moc.

By adding dynamics to our pose, we can give the impression that the photo of the moc is just a snapshot in time, and that the moc has a bit of a life of it's own outside of the photo we took.

A basic bit of dynamics you can add to a moc is to make it look like it's stepping or walking. It is a good idea to look at reference photos for this to make sure the limbs are bent in the right way.

A basic approach to adding dynamics is to think about the way that your moc might move. Then, pose it as if it's halfway through moving.

Of course, it doesn't just have to be the moc that's moving. You can add dynamics to things like energy effects or the environment.
