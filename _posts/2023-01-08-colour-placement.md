Where we choose to place colours in our build has a lot of impact on how the viewer sees it. This is part of why colour blocking is so important.

Our eyes are drawn to bright, vibrant colours. For example, in a build consisting of mostly darker neutral colours, a pop of yellow or red will really draw the eye.

We can take advantage of this by putting contrasting colours in places where we want people to look. Conversely, in areas we don't want people to look (less polished, etc) we can use darker more neutral colours so that our eyes mostly ignore it.

A good example of this is to use a bright, contrasting colour for the eyes of our moc. Humans naturally look to identify the eyes of something, so this is a good place to think carefully about colour placement.
