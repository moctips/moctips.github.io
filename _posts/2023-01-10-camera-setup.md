Most good-quality moc photos are taken with a dedicated camera such as a DSLR or mirrorless camera. These cameras feature better sensor resolution, low-light performance, higher dynamic range, and have more options available for lenses.

A modern phone camera (most phone cameras released after 2020) can have comparable performance at wider focal lengths. Some builders (like me) prefer a longer focal length closer to portrait lenses, in the 50-150mm range.

Dedicated cameras also tend to have better manual control options. Phone cameras also have manual options or apps can be purchased to expose them.

There are three different things you can control when dialling in the exposure:

- Aperture: This one determines how much light comes into the camera and also how much of the build is in focus. A wider aperture lets more light in and results a shallower depth-of-field (less in focus). Wider apertures have smaller f-stops (f/1.8, f/2.4, etc). A narrower aperture lets in less light and results in a wider depth-of-field (more in focus). Narrower apertures have larger f-stop (f/8, f/9, f/11, etc).
- Because we are taking photos of our builds, we usually want all of it to be in focus. For this reason, I recommend using an aperture between f8 and f11. Narrower apertures are often possible (up to around f/22), but this results in diffraction and lower exposure and does not usually give a clearer image.
- ISO: This one determines how sensitive your camera’s sensor is to light. If you decrease the ISO, the sensor becomes less sensitive and it takes more light to produce an equivalent exposure. If you increase the ISO, the sensor becomes less sensitive and it takes less light to produce an equivalent exposure. The higher you set the ISO, the “grainier” your images become. For a clean photo, set your ISO as low as possible. In a well-lit environment you may be able to push the ISO down to 100-200 which will result in a very clear photo. An ISO above 1000 can result in a grainy image.
- Shutter speed: This one determines how long the camera’s shutter is open. While it’s open, the sensor will collect light. Because we are taking photos of still subjects, we have the most freedom with shutter speed. By taking photos with a self-timer and a tripod, we can get very clear images even when the shutter is open for 2-3 seconds. If you are taking photos in a room with not a lot of light, you may need to increase the shutter speed. You should never need a shutter speed faster than something like 1/32 of a second - if you are able to get a good exposure with that shutter speed then your ISO is probably too high

Try to adjust your camera’s settings in the order of aperture -> ISO -> shutter speed.

A tripod is a great idea when taking photos. It allows you to take clear photos with longer exposures. It also makes it easy to adjust the height of the camera relative to the build.

When taking photos, imagine that your moc exists in the real world. Imagine that the camera is your eyes and is positioned at what would be your head height. If you imagine your moc to be taller than you, then you should position the camera below the moc’s head and angle it upwards (shooting from a “lower angle”). Shooting from a lower angle can give a build more presence and makes it feel more imposing. In contrast, if you want your build to appear smaller, you can position the camera above the moc’s head and angle it downwards (shooting from a “higher angle”). This can make a build feel smaller or more like a toy.

One of the easiest ways to improve your presentation is to take photos from a lower angle.
