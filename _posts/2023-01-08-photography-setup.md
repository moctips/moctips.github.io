Moc photography is similar to product photography.

Generally speaking, we want a plain and simple background so that the focus is entirely on our moc.

Many builders prefer to to have a single-coloured background.

You can use a single large piece of posterboard (thick paper) to construct a seamless background. Simply tape the bottom of the posterboard to a sturdy flat surface, and tape the top to a wall. This will make a gradual curve for your background.

The more gradual the curve, the smoother the background. However, keep in mind that you still want enough posterboard to be flat for your moc to stand on.

If you plan on doing more extensive editing (such as replacing or recolouring the background), it can be helpful to use a background colour that does not appear anywhere in your moc for easy colour-based selection.

I personally prefer natural light (from the sun) over artificial light (lamps, flash) for moc photography. You will want to set this up in an area with lots of natural light, but not in direct light. Most of the light should be bouncing off the walls and ceiling, rather than coming (for example) straight through a window.
