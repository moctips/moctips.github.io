Textural consistency means that you consistently use one combination of colour and texture to represent one "material".

Each time we see one colour in a build, it should have the same texture and correspond to the same material.

If we combine this with colour blocking and layering, it becomes very easy to figure out what parts of a build correspond to what.

For example, you might have use smooth black pieces as the base layer to represent the "body" of the moc. Then, you could use larger silver pieces as a kind of armor plating. Finally, you could use red cloth elements for a cape.
