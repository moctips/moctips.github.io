We can take inspiration from the world around us to add familiarity to our builds.

This could be anything:

- Organic (e.g. antlers, fins, crab claws)
- Man-made (e.g. guitar, jacket, headphones)
- Natural (e.g. fire, plant, crystal)

You can still make something brand new while referencing things we are already familiar with.
